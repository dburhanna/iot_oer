%\section{Abstract}
This thesis presents a modular curriculum developed to teach 
problem solving using the Internet of Things (IOT).  The Internet of Things is a broad concept dealing with devices communicating to other devices over the Internet often with no human intervention.   Examples of connected "things" exist all around us in the world today with an estimated 30 billion IOT devices currently active\cite{8720135}.  The requirements to create an end-to-end IOT solution are diverse and require knowledge and experience to integrate properly.   The curriculum is designed to be customized for a given audience based on prior knowledge and available resources.  The curriculum is broken down into modules with each module exposing the student to a complete end-to-end solution.  Project based hardware modules are presented using microcontroller based devices and single board computer based devices.  A software only simulation module is included as well.  The modular curriculum can be used as an introductory course which includes basic programming and problem solving or as a higher level course which focuses more on application specific problems that are common when developing an Internet of Things solution.  


\\(WORKING IDEAS: problem solving is key - 
project based learning - 
hands on/experiential- 
modular - 
low cost/no cost)
