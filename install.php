        <h2>Things to do before starting this course</h2>
        <p>
            After completing Module 1's introduction to general Internet of Things concepts and systems you will dive right into learning the Python Programming language.  It is best to take the time now to get some things installed and ready for the remaining modules.
        </p>
        <p>
            When programming, we often use something called an IDE or Integrated Development Environment.  An IDE is software that allows us to edit, debug and run our Python programs, all from one convenient location.
            There are many different Python IDEs available for students to use.  The <a href="http://codewith.mu">Mu</a> IDE was chosen for this course.  Mu is designed as a simple IDE for beginners and includes support for both standard Python and CircuitPython on Adafruit's CircuitPython capable boards.

                You can also set up Python under Windows-10 using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
                if you prefer a Linux-like experience on your windows computer.
            </li>

            If you are on the go and would like to work on strictly Python code, there are many other cloud-based Python environments available such as:
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    <a href="http://pythonanywhere.com">PythonAnywhere</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://trinket.io">Trinket</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://c9.io">Cloud9</a>
                </li>
                <li>   
                    <a href="http://codeanywhere.com">CodeAnywhere</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://repl.it">repl.it</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            These online environments will allow you to work on your general Python coding skills but will not integrate with the IOT hardware we will be using in this course.
