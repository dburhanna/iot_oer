        <h2>Setting up your Python Development Environment</h2>
        <p>
            There are many different Python Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) available for students to use.  The <a href="http://codewith.mu">Mu</a> environment was chosen for this course.  Mu is designed for beginners and includes support for both standard Python and CircuitPython on Adafruit's CircuitPython capable boards.

            <li>
                <a href="software-win.php">Setting up the Mu IDE in Microsoft Windows</a>

                You can also set up Python under Windows-10 using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
                if you prefer a Linux-like experience on your windows computer.

        </ul>
